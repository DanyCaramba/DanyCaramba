Hi! I'm a passionate software developer focused on building efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions using a wide range of technologies. I primarily work with .NET, Java, React, React Native, and Angular, developing full-stack applications and tackling real-world challenges with clean code and thoughtful architecture. 🚀

On my GitHub, you’ll find various projects that reflect my interest in backend systems, RESTful APIs, responsive web applications, and cross-platform mobile solutions. I'm always curious about new tools and frameworks, and I enjoy contributing to meaningful software that brings value to users. 💻✨

I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and collaborating with other developers to build great things together. Let’s connect and create something awesome! 🤝
